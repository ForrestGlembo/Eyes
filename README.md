# Eyes


Description-

This is a project that tested our ability to combine event listeners with javascript and css, as well as replicate elements that had been created. 

How to run-

Simply move your mouse across the screen and watch the eyes follow the movement. 

Roadmap-

I would like to add the ability to have the eyes become cross eyed or even potentially lose controll and spin wildly if the user were to move their mouse too quickly.
